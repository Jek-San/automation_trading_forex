13:08:17 | WARNING  | core.telegram.group_parsers.nasdqgoldus30 | Incomplete short-format signal: 🪙 **Market Impact on Gold (XAU/USD) Wednesday, October 15, 2025**
❤**Gold continues its record-setting rally**, approaching **$4,200** during the Asian session on Wednesday, supported by safe-haven demand.
**Key drivers:**
🟠**Geopolitical tensions:** The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, escalating U.S.–China trade tensions, and the risk of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown are pushing investors toward gold.
🟠**Fed rate-cut expectations: **Markets are pricing in two more interest rate cuts by the Fed this year, weakening the USD and supporting gold.
**Market dynamics:**
🟠Traders continue to buy gold despite short-term overbought conditions.
🟠A slightly weaker USD due to Fed rate-cut expectations benefits gold.
🟠Market focus remains on speeches from FOMC officials for short-term guidance.
👉** In short:**
Gold continues to reach all-time highs near $4,200, driven by safe-haven demand, Fed rate-cut expectations, and geopolitical tensions. The uptrend remains intact, but investors should closely monitor Fed comments and trade developments for short-term direction.
